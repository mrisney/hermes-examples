These are reference implementations, simple interactions with EventHub REST API. 
There are examples in

- C++
- Go
- Java (SpringBoot)
- Javascript (Serverside Node.js, and Client/Browser) 
- Python

The Golang, and C++ implementations are pre-compiled executables on MS Windows X64, however, they can be run, using
MS DOS, Git Bash, or (reccommneded) MS PowerShell, there are asscoiated config.json files that can be edited.

These are straightforward reference implementations, that very simply, for explanation, perform : 

1. Get a token from the Kong API Token service, with credentials (supplied).
2. Preparing a JSON payload, and posting the event to a EventHub service.
